# ThaiDataBank
This repository are one of the good places where you can find data from reliable Thai sources.
- Automation scripts written in Python are created for data mining/extraction.
- Data will be cleaned as necessary and placed in array for ease of analysis.
- This is an initial phrase of this project and there are so many things to do. Support is always welcomed. I'm just a script newbie. :-P

Hope you'll find something interesting from these data.
