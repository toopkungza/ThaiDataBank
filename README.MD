# ThaiDataBank
This repository is one of the good places where you can find data from various, reliable Thai sources.
- Automation scripts written in Python are created for data mining/extraction or for reaching the set goals.
- Data will be cleaned as necessary and placed in array for ease of analysis. Usually .csv will be placed in the main branch.
- This is an initial phrase of this project and there are so many things to do. Support is always welcomed, especially advices on coding. I'm just a script newbie. 😋

All credits go to the sources of raw data. Many thanks to Dr. Attapol Thamrongrattanarit-Rutherford (http://attapol.github.io) for my inspiration for coding.
I hope you'll find something interesting from these data.

#UPDATE on July 21, 2022
- Project 1 - Schools in Thailand (Status: Completed, for now.)
  - .csv can be imported to Excel by going to Data tab, selecting From Text/CSV under Get & Transform Data, and then locating the .csv file you've downloaded. 🕊️🕊️
  - Python Code for the whole extraction/data treatment/data transformation, as well as all of the raw data are placed in the SchoolsinThai folder. Visit the folder to find more cool staff relating to this project! 
  - All credits go to the source of raw data. I am just extracted them and recombined them in the way that I think is much easier for others to use.
  - All schools and their details are subject to change. As of July 21, the school details are quite accurate.E-mails are masked to protect schools from unwanted attacks. Exercise some cautions before using the data.
  - Hope this'll make your life easier. 🙂🙂

- Project 2 - TO BE DEFINED...
